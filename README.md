# SMS Spam Detection
This project aims to detect whether an SMS message is spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam.

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning: The dataset underwent preprocessing to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the distribution of spam and not spam messages, identify patterns, and visualize features.

3. Text Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming were applied to prepare the text data for model training.

4. Model Building: Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for their performance in classifying SMS messages. The models considered include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

5. Evaluation: The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of 97.10% and a precision of 100%.

6. Improvement: Future improvements to the model could involve fine-tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different text preprocessing techniques, and exploring advanced machine learning algorithms.

## Website: The SMS spam detection model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input SMS messages and receive predictions on whether they are spam or not spam.
